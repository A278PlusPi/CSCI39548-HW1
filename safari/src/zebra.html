            Zebras(subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats.
            Zebras, Horses and Donkey all belong to the same Equidae family. 
            Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual like fingerprints for humans.
            For food they like to eat grass and are primarily herbivores. They're known for being unpredictable
            and can harm humans which is why it is not allowed to interact with them here.
