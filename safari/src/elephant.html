         Elephants are the largest existing land animals.
         Distinctive features of elephants include a long trunk, 
         tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive skin.
         The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water
         to the mouth, and grasping objects.
         African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, 
         and convex or level backs. See if you can spot them!
         Another one of the social animals we have and you can interact  with them in safe designated areas.
