            The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. 
            It is the tallest living terrestrial animal on Earth. 
            It's extinguishing characteristics are its long-neck and spotted coat patterns.
            They like eating leaves and fruits and are herbivores! 
            Giraffe's are social animals and we have designated safe areas in our safari where 
            you can pet them or feed them!
