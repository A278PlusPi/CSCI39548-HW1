        <h1> Kasaf's Safari Park</h1>
        <p>
            Kasaf's Safari Park is one of the division under the Hark Zoo.Visitors drive through the park 
            in their cars and can explore and see the animals in their natural habitat. Our park strives to
            provide the animals we host as close to natural environments as we can. Some parts of the park
            are safe zones where you can open the windows and interact with the animals, while others are not. 
            It is important to note that these are still wild animals and human contact is dangerous for both 
            parties invovled.
