    <p>   
      Blue whales are the largest animals ever known to have lived on Earth.
      They  can grow to over 30-metres in length, but are extremely graceful swimmers. 
      They typically have a cruising speed of around 8-kilometres per hour, 
      and can hit top speeds of up to 50 kph.
      Due to the relative sizes of both the blue whale and krill, they can 
      consume as many as 40 million krill.
