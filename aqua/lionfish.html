        Lionfish are a group of fish known for their maroon, white or black stripes, intricate fins, 
        and venomous spiky extensions. 
        The 13 long fins that extend from the spine of the lionfish are venomous and used to deter predators
        To humans, a lionfish sting is extremely painful and can bring about severe nausea and impair breathing. 
        Fortunately, while unpleasant, injuries are rarely fatal.
