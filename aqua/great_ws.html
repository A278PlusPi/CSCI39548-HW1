        Great white sharkars the largest predatory fish on our planet.
        They are grey with a white underbelly, from where they get their name. 
        They have a streamlined shape and powerful tails that propel them through the water at over 60km per hour.
        Any creature unlucky enough to find itself in the gob of a great white is in for a nasty shock! Because this 
        marine beast's mouth is equipped with a set of 300 sharp, triangular teeth arranged in up to seven rows.
        Whilst many think of these beasts as fearsome man-eaters, humans aren't, in fact, on the great white's menu.
