    <h1>African Penguin</h1>
    <p>
      <i>
        The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), also known as Cape penguin or
        South African penguin, is a species of penguin confined to southern
        African waters. Like all extant penguins, it is flightless, with a
        streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a
        marine habitat. Adults weigh an average of 2.2–3.5 kg (4.9–7.7 lb) and
        are 60–70 cm (24–28 in) tall. The species has distinctive pink patches
        of skin above the eyes and a black facial mask. The body's upper parts
        are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts, which are
        spotted and marked with a black band.
