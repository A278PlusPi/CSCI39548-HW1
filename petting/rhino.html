      <i
        >The Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), or Indian rhino for
        short, also known as the greater one-horned rhinoceros or great Indian
        rhinoceros, is a rhinoceros species native to the Indian subcontinent.
        It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as populations are
        fragmented and restricted to less than 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi).
        Moreover, the extent and quality of the rhino's most important habitat,
        the alluvial Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands and riverine forest, is
        considered to be in decline due to human and livestock encroachment.
