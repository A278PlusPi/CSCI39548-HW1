        long-necked cud-chewing hoofed mammals of Africa, with long legs and a
        coat pattern of irregular brown patches on a light background. Giraffes

        (18 feet) in height, and the tallest females (cows) are about 4.5
        metres.Using prehensile tongues almost half a metre long, they are able
        to browse foliage almost six metres from the ground. Giraffes are a
        common sight in grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa, where they
        can be seen in reserves such as Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park and
        Kenya’s Amboseli National Park. The genus Giraffa is made up of the
        northern giraffe (G. camelopardalis), the southern giraffe (G. giraffa),
        the Masai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi), and the reticulated giraffe (G.
        reticulata).
