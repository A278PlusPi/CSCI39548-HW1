        <p class = "body">These australopithecines were human-like species, but had closer resemblance to apes, because there were earlier in the human evolution. They have human-like features such as walking upright on two legs, and small teeth, but also with ape-like features such as a flat nose, strong jaws, curved fingers, and small brain.</p>
