        <p class = "body">Dinosaurs were a large group of reptiles that lived during the Triassic Period about 240 years ago. They all lived when all of Earth’s continents (a.k.a. Pangaea) were together. We still don’t know how exactly dinosaurs were extinct, but one possible cause is that a huge asteroid had hit Earth, which caused all living things to disappear at that time.</p>
